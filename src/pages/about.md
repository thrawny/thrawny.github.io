Hello. My name is Jonas and this is my personal website that I use to write down my thoughts about software development mostly, but maybe some other stuff will sneak in once in a while.

I have been working as a Software Engineer or similar for more than 10 years with fairly broad interests like programming languages, databases, cloud and kubernetes.
