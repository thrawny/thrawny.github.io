description: Some thoughts when creating the website and a quick retrospective on the last year.
---

At the time of writing this it is mid 2025, and I am looking back at the last year in terms of what I have been doing for work. A lot has changed for me as it has for lots people.

These days I spend lots of time thinking about how to use AI in my work. One reason for creating this website was to be able to articulate my thoughts out load and write things down.

My hope is that someone will find something useful out of reading this stuff. I can't promise that you will, but I can promise that all the texts that you find here will be written by a human. The code for website however, will often not be.
