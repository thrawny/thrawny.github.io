description: Side questing with agentic coding tools.
---

Many have noticed, including myself, that using agentic coding tools can make you more ambitious.

When you use these tools, no task is too boring, too small, too unimportant to be attacked. All you have to do is think a thought and write the initial prompt, and there you go. You have started.

With the risk of anthropomorphizing, your pair programmer in the cloud (that's how I usually run them) will never get tired and thinks every task you give it is the most important task it will ever work on. It will keep trying forever, keep coming up with fixes and variations and be super excited to help you try the next thing until something sticks. It will sometimes produce pure slop of course, but these days I consider that more the fault of the operator for not using the tool properly.

So finding myself in this new situation, it is hard to exercise self-control when I stumble unto something that is interesting or a nuisance at that specific moment. Something must be done now! Historically, you would put thoughts like this into the back of your mind, or worse, create a ticket in some graveyard backlog. But things have changed. You can spend hours trying to write the perfect test case for that very specific error state you know can happen, and your pair programmer can come up with insanely smart strategies, and you can ask it over and over to tweak this, and try that and maybe in the end you have something that you think has some value and is worth keeping. Or, maybe more often, you give up, conclude that you went down the wrong path, and you will try another strategy to solve the problem, but not right now. Your pair programmer will agree fully with you and think that the new strategy you thought out is much smarter, and can't wait to tackle it with you.

I love details. Which I think is one reason why, when they behave well, I can work longer and with more focus when I have my pair programmer with me. We can work towards perfection together, and the barrier to entry to try out all those ideas that are just stuck in my head is much lower. Maybe you the reader want more concrete examples. Well sure. Ever since I got my hands on claude code, I basically always have a session open in my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/thrawny/dotfiles), and can now do all the refactorings, improvements and minor fixes I want. As an example, I got my pair programmer to align the themes for the various terminal apps I use, and it did an excellent job. I would never ever have done it myself, the barrier to entry to research documentation and hand write themes for k9s, zsh, ghostty, tmux, nvim and any other app I will use in the future is just massive, but my helper can basically do it in 5 minutes. Then end result is just a small detail, something I could have lived without, and have lived without for years. But now, I don't have to anymore. As soon as I notice the tiniest problem or detail I can just address it right there in the moment. For good and bad of course. Perfection is the enemy of good and all that. Going forward I definitely need to work on striking a balance between when to just stay on the main quest and when going on that side quest is allowed.
